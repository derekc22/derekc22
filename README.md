# 👋 Hi, I'm Derek

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a graduate student at the University of Southern California pursuing an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Machine Learning and Data Science), following a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering. My work lies at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, control systems, and engineering. 

## 💡 Areas of Focus

### 🦿 Robotics and Control Systems
- System identification for actuator and sensor dynamics in legged robots
- Control algorithm testing and development in MuJoCo for terrain-robust, biomimetic locomotion
- Trajectory optimization and inverse kinematics for underactuated systems

### 🤖 Machine Learning
- Lightweight deep learning library design with unified training and evaluation pipelines (PyTorch)
- Temporal modeling using LSTM, Transformer, and TCN architectures
- High-dimensional data analysis with t-SNE, PCA, and HDBSCAN

### 🏗️ Computational Engineering & High-Performance Computing
- Large-scale structural simulations on HPC platforms using FEA and implicit/explicit solvers
- Nonlinear model development for contact mechanics and interface coupling
- State-space modeling and validation for shock-isolated mechanical systems
- Parametric sensitivity studies and workflow automation for simulation pipelines
