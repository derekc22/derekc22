# üëã Hi, I'm Derek Chibuzor

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a graduate student at the University of Southern California pursuing an M.S. in Machine Learning and Data Science, following a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering. My work lies at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, and control systems, and I am passionate about building robust and intelligent systems that integrate hardware and software effectively.

## üî¨ Current Focus

- Machine learning models for real-time robotic control
- Domain adaptation and Sim2Real transfer for legged robots
- Structural mechanics simulations and high-performance computing
- Trajectory optimization and nonlinear dynamic modeling

## üß† Experience Highlights

- **LLNL (Summer '25)**: Applied HPC techniques to simulate large-scale structural mechanics and investigated nonlinear interface dynamics.
- **Dynamic Robotics and Control Lab @ USC**: Developed ML pipelines, control algorithms, and Sim2Real strategies for robust locomotion in legged robots.
- **Northrop Grumman (2x Intern)**: Built state-space models, validated FEA simulations, and optimized dynamic isolation systems for defense structures.
- **Amazon/ISI**: Engineered a 6-DoF pose estimation and tracking algorithm for NASA‚Äôs Astrobee robot using computer vision and adaptive control.
