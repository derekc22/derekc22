# üëã Hi, I'm Derek

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a graduate student at the University of Southern California pursuing an M.S. in Electrical Engineering (Machine Learning and Data Science), following a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering. My interests lie at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, control systems, and engineering. 

## Areas of Focus

### Robotics and Control Systems
- System identification for actuator and sensor dynamics in legged robots
- Control algorithm testing and development in MuJoCo for terrain-robust, biomimetic locomotion
- Trajectory optimization and inverse kinematics for underactuated systems

### Machine Learning
- Deep learning workflow design with training and evaluation pipelines
- Temporal modeling using LSTM, Transformer, and TCN architectures
- High-dimensional data analysis with t-SNE, PCA, and HDBSCAN

### Mechanical & Computational Engineering
- State-space modeling and validation for shock-isolated mechanical systems
- Parametric sensitivity studies and workflow automation for simulation pipelines

## Experience

- **Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory**: Apply HPC and computational engineering techniques to simulate structural mechanics and investigate nonlinear interface dynamics.
- **Dynamic Robotics and Control Laboratory**: Help develop ML pipelines, control algorithms, and Sim2Real strategies for robust locomotion in legged robots.
- **Northrop Grumman**: Built state-space models, validated FEA simulations, and optimized shock isolation systems.
- **Amazon/Information Sciences Institute**: Engineered a 6-DoF pose estimation and tracking algorithm for NASA‚Äôs Astrobee robot using computer vision.

## Current Projects

### [NN](https://github.com/derekc22/NN)
A deep learning library featuring CNN, RNN, LSTM, and Transformer (WIP) architectures. Built with extensibility and educational value in mind. Models achieved:
- 99% accuracy on MNIST
- 72.1% on a Kaggle classification task
- 98.2% accuracy for stress tensor classification

### [UR3e](https://github.com/derekc22/UR3e)
A simulation environment for the Universal Robots UR3e robotic arm with integrated Robotiq 2F85 gripper built using Gymnasium and MuJoCo.
- UR3e with integrated 2F85 gripper
- Compatible with Gymnasium's RL interface for training with PPO and DQN (WIP)
- Joint force/torque sensors and touch sensors on gripper pads

## Skills

- **Languages**: Python, C++, MATLAB, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- **Machine Learning & Robotics**: PyTorch, MuJoCo, JAX, OpenCV, Gymnasium, Stable-Baselines3
- **Other** React, NodeJS, Docker, Git
