# 👋 Hi, I'm Derek

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a graduate student at the University of Southern California pursuing an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Machine Learning and Data Science), following a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering. My work lies at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, control systems, and engineering. 

## 💡 Areas of Focus

### 🦿 Robotics and Control Systems
- System identification for actuator and sensor dynamics in legged robots
- Control algorithm testing and development in MuJoCo for terrain-robust, biomimetic locomotion
- Trajectory optimization and inverse kinematics for underactuated systems

### 🤖 Machine Learning & Reinforcement Learning
- Lightweight deep learning library design with unified training and evaluation pipelines (PyTorch)
- Temporal modeling using LSTM, Transformer, and TCN architectures
- High-dimensional data analysis with t-SNE, PCA, and HDBSCAN

### 🏗️ Computational Engineering & High-Performance Computing
- Large-scale structural dynamics simulations on HPC platforms using implicit/explicit FEA solvers
- Nonlinear model development for contact mechanics and interface coupling
- State-space modeling and validation for shock-isolated mechanical systems
- Parametric sensitivity studies and workflow automation for simulation pipelines

## 🗂️ Experience

- **Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory**: Apply HPC and computational engineering techniques to simulate large-scale structural mechanics and investigate nonlinear interface dynamics.
- **Dynamic Robotics and Control Lab @ USC**: Help develop ML pipelines, control algorithms, and Sim2Real strategies for robust locomotion in legged robots.
- **Northrop Grumman**: Built state-space models, validated FEA simulations, and optimized shock isolation systems.
- **Amazon/Information Sciences Institute**: Engineered a 6-DoF pose estimation and tracking algorithm for NASA’s Astrobee robot using computer vision.
